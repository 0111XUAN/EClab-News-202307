abstract = "Social networking site users are constantly exposed to the glamorized lifestyles and over-positive profiles of other people. A great deal of investigation has shown that the use of social networking sites is linked to the experience of upward comparison, yielding both threat-oriented and challenge-oriented responses. Yet, limited research has studied what determines these differential responses. To capture the intraindividual fluctuations in online activities, a daily diary study (1,328 diary reports) was conducted to examine the associations between Instagram use and two unexplored and sharply different reactions, namely 1) gossiping, a threat-oriented reaction that aims to pull others down, and 2) self-improvement, a challenge-oriented reaction that leads one to level up. Results indicated that daily Instagram use was positively associated with both gossiping and self-improvement. Critically, these within-person associations were subjected to the cross-level moderation effects of one’s dispositional malicious and benign envy. Specifically, the link between Instagram use and gossiping was stronger among those high in dispositional malicious envy, while the link between Instagram use and self-improvement was stronger among those high in dispositional benign envy. Finally, a series of comparisons was conducted on the within-person associations and cross-level moderations to strengthen our understanding of Instagram use."

summary = "该研究使用了来自印度和美国的两个小组，探讨了各种游戏体验对玩家满意度和重赛意图的影响。在印度样本中，积极情感对游戏流程、沉浸和社交体验产生积极影响，而消极情感对其他游戏体验影响不大。在美国样本中，积极情感和游戏流程经验正向影响玩家的满意度和再次游玩意愿，沉浸体验对这些意愿没有影响，社交体验对满意度有积极作用，但不影响再次游玩意愿。"
abstract = "Massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) constitute a genre of online games that has enjoyed phenomenal market success due to in-game purchases and push advertising. Despite the genre's popularity, little is known about players' experiences with these games. Using an Indian panel of 319 players and a U.S. panel of 425 players, we examined multiple game experiences and the impacts of each on players' satisfaction and replay intentions. Study 1 explored Indian players' positive and negative feelings; findings showed that positive feelings positively influenced flow, immersive, and social experiences, whereas negative feelings had no significant effects on other game experiences. Study 2 addressed U.S. players' game experiences as well as their satisfaction and replay intentions. While positive feelings and flow experiences positively affected players' satisfaction and replay intentions, immersive experience did not. Social experiences played a positive role in players' satisfaction but did not influence their replay intentions. Results highlight the importance of positive game experiences and carry managerial implications for game marketers and designers."

summary = "该研究分析了抖音上的441个短视频及其8315条评论，以检验用以惩罚为中心的框架揭穿错误信息的视频如何提高揭穿的有效性。我们的研究结果表明，观众正义的愤怒，可能是由视频内容引发的，这些内容倾向于惩罚错误信息的创作者和传播者。"
abstract = "The concerning proliferation of misinformation and its adverse consequences have spurred considerable effort among scholars and practitioners to debunk misinformation. Nevertheless, few studies have investigated how emotions influence the effectiveness of debunking. In our study, following the cognitive functional model, we analyzed 441 short videos on Douyin and their 8315 comments to examine how videos that debunk misinformation with punishment-focused frames improve the effectiveness of debunking. Our results demonstrate that the audience's anger, which we characterize as righteous anger, can be induced by video content that primes a preference for the punishment of creators and spreaders of misinformation. Moreover, when anger facilitates the audience's trust in debunking, message involvement and argument quality can intensify their anger."

abstract = "People often form first impressions of others based on face and/or voice cues. This study aimed to compare the first impressions formed under these two cues. First, we compared free descriptions based on face and voice cues and found differences in the content and frequency of the personality words. We then compiled three wordlists used for face-based and voice-based first impression evaluations separately or simultaneously. Second, using these wordlists, we compared face-based and voice-based first impression ratings and found that both had significant intra-rater and inter-rater reliability. However, using the mean of the actors' self-rating and their acquaintance rating as the validity criterion, only the ratings of ‘ingenuous’ and ‘mature’ traits in the face-based first impression evaluation were significantly correlated with the validity criterion. Factor analysis revealed that face-based first impression had the dimensions of capability and approachability, while voice-based first impression had capability, approachability and reliability. The findings indicate that stable first impressions can be formed by either face or voice cues. However, the specific composition of impressions will vary between the cues. These results also provide a foundation for studying first impressions formed by an integrated perception of voice and face cues."
