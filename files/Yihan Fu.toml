summary = "完美主义社交隔离模型认为，完美主义个体表现出令人反感的人际行为（即拒绝敏感性和敌意），导致社交隔离，从而加剧心理困扰。本研究旨在探讨完美主义与社交隔离之间的关系，结果表明虽然完美主义与拒绝敏感性和敌意存在关联，但在个体层面这些行为可能不会导致社交隔离。" 
abstract = "Objective: Perfectionism is linked to a variety of mental health conditions in university students. The Perfectionism Social Disconnection Model posits that perfectionistic individuals exhibit off-putting interpersonal behaviors (i.e., rejection sensitivity and hostility), which lead to social disconnection, and in turn contribute to psychological distress. Although several longitudinal studies have found that social disconnection mediates the link between perfectionistic traits and psychological distress, less is known about how perfectionism leads to social disconnection. The present study aimed to address this gap. Methods: A sample of 877 university students completed one survey a month for three consecutive months. Results: Our random-intercept cross-lagged panel model results showed significant positive associations between the random intercepts of socially prescribed and self-oriented perfectionism with rejection sensitivity, hostility, and loneliness, with stronger associations for socially prescribed perfectionism. In addition, the random intercept of other-oriented perfectionism showed positive associations with hostility but not rejection sensitivity or loneliness. Moreover, almost all cross-lagged paths were nonsignificant. Conclusion: Collectively, these findings indicate that although perfectionistic traits may be associated with rejection sensitivity and hostility to varying degrees at the between-person level, these behaviors may not cause social disconnection at the within-person level."

summary = "利用元分析结构方程模型（MASEM），研究了大五人格特质与主观幸福感（SWB）之间的关联，将其分解为三个独立组成部分: 生活满意度（LS）、积极情绪（PA）和消极情绪（NA）。研究发现，大五人格特质与主观幸福感之间存在独特关联，其中积极情绪和消极情绪的频率对主观幸福感有重要影响，" 
abstract = "Objective/Background: Using meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM), we examined the link between Big Five personality traits and subjective well-being (SWB), operationalized as three separate components and as a latent factor indicated by life satisfaction (LS), positive affect (PA), and negative affect (NA). PA and NA were assessed based on frequency of a broad range of affective experiences, rather than intensity of high arousal affective experiences, thus excluding studies using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. Method:35 samples were included, encompassing 22,135 participants from 14 countries, in which all eight variables were assessed. Results: Correlations among personality traits were moderate, on average, and the latent SWB factor had strong loadings from all three components. Personality traits together explained substantial variance in LS, PA, and NA, and in the latent SWB factor, with unique predictive effects on the latent factor from each personality trait except openness. Associations between personality traits and SWB components were fully accounted for by a latent SWB factor, with one exception: A specific association was found between neuroticism and unique variance in NA. Conclusions: The present findings provide new insights concerning the notion of a happy personality in showing that Big Five personality traits have unique associations with an underlying sense of SWB."

abstract = "Objective: To assess whether there are individual differences in emotional reactions to bistable images, and if so, to identify some of the psychological factors that predict them. Background: Bistable images which have two competing perceptual interpretations have long been used in the scientific study of consciousness. Here we applied a different lens and investigated emotional reactions to them. Method: Participants were adult humans in a cross-sectional study. Participants were presented with three bistable images and rated their emotional reactions to experiencing bistability. They also completed measures of intolerance of uncertainty, cognitive empathy, affective empathy, and negative affect. Results: There were marked individual differences in these reactions, ranging from feeling highly negative to highly positive. These individual differences in emotional response to bistability were linked to a number of psychological processes: intolerance of uncertainty, cognitive empathy, and negative affect, but not affective empathy. Conclusions: These finding have important implications because: (a) these emotional reactions could distort scientific investigations that use these stimuli to study non-emotional perceptual and cognitive processes; and (b) they highlight that this approach offers a useful window into how individuals react to these stimuli that demonstrate that there is not always a single viable interpretation of the world around us."

abstract = "Objectives: Examine the group-specific connections between personality, ideology, and the moral emotions of empathy and schadenfreude. Background: Empathy and schadenfreude are emotions that often lead to moral prosocial or spiteful harmful behaviors respectively. An outstanding question is what motivates feelings of empathy and schadenfreude towards people from different groups. Here we examine two prominent motivators of emotions: personality traits and ideology. Previous work has found that people\'92s ideological orientations towards respecting traditionalism (RWA) and preferences about group-based hierarchy (SDO) can impact intergroup emotions. Further, personality traits of low agreeableness, low openness, and high conscientiousness uniquely engender SDO and RWA. Method: In the research presented here (Study 1 n = 492; Study 2 n = 786), we examine the relationships between personality traits, ideology, and emotions for groups that are perceived to be dangerous and competitive. We hypothesize that SDO and RWA will relate to reduced empathy and increased schadenfreude but towards unique groups. SDO will relate to reduced empathy and increased schadenfreude towards competitive, low-status groups while RWA will relate to reduced empathy and increased schadenfreude towards threatening groups. We further extend past work by investigating left-wing authoritarianism as well. Results: We find broad support for our expectation that the relationships between personality and emotions, as well as ideology and emotions, depend on the specific group in question. Conclusions: These results help expand the dual process motivational model of prejudice and suggest the importance of specifying a target group when assessing relationships between personality, ideology, and emotions."
